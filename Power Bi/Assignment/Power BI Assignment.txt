ANS 1:

Use Power BI: when you need real-time dashboards, to analyze large datasets, integrate with multiple data
                          sources, or share interactive reports across an organization.
Use Excel: for ad-hoc analysis, detailed tabular calculations, or when working on smaller datasets.
                    Power BI and Excel complement each other well and can be used together for more powerful analytics. For instance, you can prepare data in Excel and then load it into Power BI for visualization.

ANS 2:

1. Tables

Fact Tables: Contain measurable, quantitative data, such as sales, revenue, or transactions. These are the core of analysis.
Dimension Tables: Contain descriptive information, such as dates, product categories, or customer details, used to slice and filter fact data.
Relationships

Define how tables interact with each other using keys (e.g., primary and foreign keys).
2. Relationship types:
One-to-Many (1:N): The most common, where one record in a dimension table maps to many records in a fact table.
Many-to-Many (N:N): Used for complex data structures.
One-to-One (1:1): Less common, often used for lookups or additional details.
Star and Snowflake Schemas

3. Star Schema: A central fact table connected directly to dimension tables. It's simple and efficient.
Snowflake Schema: Dimension tables are normalized and linked through other tables, which can make queries slower but save storage.
4. Data Types and Formatting

Each column in a table has a data type (e.g., text, number, date). Consistent data types are crucial for smooth relationships and calculations.
Calculated Columns and Measures

5. Calculated Columns: Add custom columns to a table based on data or logic. They are static within the model.
Measures: Dynamic calculations that respond to filters or slicers, written using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
6. Relationships Cardinality and Filters

Cardinality determines how many instances of a row in one table relate to rows in another (e.g., one-to-many).
Filter Direction: Relationships can be single-directional or bi-directional, influencing how filters flow through the model.
7. Data Hierarchies

Define logical groupings (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month > Day) to make data exploration intuitive.

ANS 5:

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI, Excel, and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to define custom calculations, aggregations, and business logic for data analysis. DAX is a powerful tool for creating calculated columns, measures, and tables that enable advanced reporting and analytics in Power BI.



Why DAX is Important in Power BI
1. Custom Calculations:

DAX enables users to define measures for dynamic aggregations and calculations that respond to filters and slicers in reports.
Example: Calculating Profit Margin as Profit Margin = DIVIDE(SUM(Profit), SUM(Sales)).
2. Enhanced Reporting:

Create calculated columns for custom data fields.
Example: Categorizing sales performance as "High" or "Low" based on a threshold.
3. Time Intelligence:

Perform date-related calculations like year-to-date (YTD), quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), and cumulative totals.
Example: Total Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales), Dates[Date]).
4. Dynamic Aggregations:

DAX measures are recalculated dynamically based on user interactions with visuals.
Example: Displaying sales data by product, region, or time with consistent formulas.
5. Data Insights:

Create advanced analytics like rankings, trends, and comparisons.
Example: Top 5 Products by Sales = TOPN(5, Products, SUM(Sales)).

ANS 6:

Use calculated columns:  for static, row-level values.
Use measures:  for dynamic, context-aware aggregations or calculations.
In most scenarios, measures are preferred for efficiency and flexibility.

ANS 7:

Best Practices for Handling Relationships
1. Use a Star Schema:

Simplifies relationships and improves query performance.
Avoid snowflake schemas or overly normalized tables unless necessary.
2. Minimize Bidirectional Relationships:

Use only when necessary to reduce complexity and improve performance.
3. Set Data Types Consistently:

Ensure related columns have the same data type (e.g., integer, text).
4. Avoid Many-to-Many Unless Needed:

Use a bridge table when feasible to maintain control over relationships.
5. Optimize Performance:

Avoid unnecessary columns in tables.
Reduce the size of data and complexity of relationships.
6. Test with DAX:

Use DAX measures to verify relationships work as expected:
DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
7. Use Relationship Labels:

Name relationships descriptively in the Model view to make maintenance easier.


ANS 8:

Purpose of a Power BI Gateway
1. Enable Data Refresh:

A Power BI Gateway ensures that reports and dashboards hosted on the Power BI Service are automatically updated with the latest data from on-premises sources.
Example: Updating a dashboard with data from an on-premises SQL Server database.
2. Facilitate Live Connections:

For live data analysis, the gateway allows Power BI to query on-premises databases directly in real-time without uploading the data.
3. Secure Data Transfer:

The gateway uses strong encryption and secure communication protocols to transmit data between on-premises sources and the Power BI Service.

Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI:
Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI is a feature that restricts data access at the row level for users viewing a report or dashboard. It allows report creators to define rules that control what data a specific user or group can see, ensuring sensitive information is only visible to authorized users.

Types of RLS:

1. Static RLS:

Filters are hardcoded in the role definition.
Example: A role where users see only rows related to "North America."
2. Dynamic RLS:

Filters are based on user attributes, such as their username or group membership.

DAX
[Region] = LOOKUPVALUE(Users[Region], Users[Username], USERNAME())
This rule dynamically filters data based on the Region associated with the logged-in user.

Best Practices for RLS:
1. Use Dynamic RLS for Scalability:

Dynamic roles eliminate the need to create separate roles for each user or group.
2. Optimize Filter Logic:

Ensure DAX expressions in roles are efficient to avoid performance issues.
3. Test Thoroughly:

Use the View as Role feature in Power BI Desktop to validate role definitions.
4. Minimize Hardcoding:

Use user attributes and lookup tables for flexibility.
5. Combine with Azure AD Groups:

Assign roles to Azure Active Directory groups for easier management.

ANS 11:

Power BI Desktop:  is a local development tool for creating reports, data models, and performing data transformations. It is ideal for building complex reports and preparing datasets before publishing them to the cloud.

Power BI Service:  is a cloud-based platform that enables sharing, collaboration, and consumption of reports and dashboards. It also offers features for data refresh, real-time collaboration, and security management.

ANS 12:

Direct Query in Power BI:

Direct Query is a mode in Power BI that allows you to connect directly to a data source without importing the data into Power BI. This means that instead of loading the data into Power BI's internal storage, queries are sent to the data source in real-time when users interact with reports or dashboards. Direct Query is particularly useful for working with large datasets or when you need to ensure that the data always reflects the most up-to-date information from the source.

When to Use Direct Query:

1. Large Datasets: When the dataset is too large to import into Power BI, Direct Query allows you to work with the data without loading it into memory.

2. Real-Time Data: When you need to ensure that the data displayed in reports is always up-to-date, such as in operational or transactional reporting.

3. Data Security: When you want to leverage the security settings of the underlying data source, ensuring that users see only the data they are authorized to view.

4. Cloud-Based or On-Premises Databases: If your data is stored in cloud databases (like Azure SQL Database) or on-premises systems that support Direct Query, this mode can provide a seamless experience.

Direct Query in Power BI allows for real-time querying of data from external sources without importing it into Power BI. This mode is beneficial when you need to work with large datasets or always up-to-date data, but it comes with certain limitations in terms of performance, data transformations, and the flexibility of the data model. DirectQuery is ideal for scenarios where data freshness and minimizing data storage are critical.

ANS 13:

Power BI Templates:

A Power BI Template is a reusable file (.PBIT) that contains the structure of a report, including the data model, queries, and visualizations, but without the data itself. Essentially, a Power BI template is a blueprint for creating reports. It allows users to share and distribute reports with predefined layouts, visualizations, and calculations while enabling others to input their own data.

Power BI templates can be useful for standardized reporting, collaboration, and quick deployment of similar reports across different datasets or organizations.


How to Use Power BI Templates:

1. Create a Template:

In Power BI Desktop, after you’ve designed your report with the required data model, visualizations, and transformations, you can save it as a template.
Go to File > Export > Power BI Template.
Power BI will prompt you to remove any sensitive data (i.e., actual data in your tables) and will save the file as a .PBIT file.
2. Open a Template:

To use a Power BI template, open the .PBIT file in Power BI Desktop.
You’ll be prompted to connect to a data source. Once the data source is connected, the report will load with the data and visualizations from the template.
3. Deploy Templates:

Templates can be shared with other users by sending the .PBIT file.
For large-scale deployment, templates can be stored in a shared location (e.g., company intranet, cloud storage) for easy access by teams or departments.

ANS 14:

How Incremental Refresh Works
Incremental refresh splits the data into two main parts:

1. Historical data: This includes data that doesn't change often or that has already been loaded.
2. Recent data: This includes data that is added or updated after a certain point in time (e.g., the last few days or months).
When incremental refresh is enabled:

Power BI queries and refreshes only the recent data, while the historical data remains unchanged and is not queried again.
A date-based partitioning system is used to partition data based on a date field (typically a date or datetime column), so Power BI knows which data needs to be refreshed and which can remain static.

ANS 15:

Role of Power Query in Power BI:

Power Query is a powerful data connection, transformation, and preparation tool integrated into Power BI. It plays a central role in the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) before the data is used for analysis and visualization. Power Query allows users to connect to a variety of data sources, transform and clean the data, and then load it into Power BI for modeling and reporting.

Use Cases for Power Query in Power BI:

1. Data Cleaning:

Power Query is frequently used for cleaning datasets, such as handling missing or invalid values, removing duplicates, correcting data formats, and filtering out irrelevant records.
2. Combining Multiple Sources:

Power Query makes it easy to combine data from different sources (e.g., joining tables from different databases or merging multiple Excel sheets) into a unified dataset.
3. Aggregating and Summarizing Data:

It can be used to aggregate data, for example, summing sales figures by region, calculating averages, or grouping transactions by customer.
4. Transforming Raw Data into Structured Data:

Raw, unstructured data can be transformed into a more structured format that is easier to work with for reporting and analysis, such as unpivoting or pivoting tables.
5. Merging Data from Multiple Tables:

Power Query is ideal for merging or joining data from multiple tables or sources, allowing users to consolidate data for analysis or reporting.
6. Consolidating Periodic Data:

In scenarios where data is collected in periodic batches (e.g., weekly reports), Power Query can be used to append data from new files to existing datasets automatically.

ANS 16:

Calculated Columns:  are used to create new columns in an existing table, calculated row by row. They are useful when you need to add data to your table at a row level, such as when creating calculated metrics like profit, margin, or status based on the data in each row.

Calculated Tables:  create entirely new tables based on DAX expressions. These tables can be used to summarize data, apply filters, or create lookup tables (like a Date Table). Calculated tables are useful when you need a new structure, often involving aggregates or derived datasets.

ANS 17:

1. Using the Power BI Visuals Marketplace:  is the easiest way to add custom visuals to your report. You can find a variety of pre-built visuals that enhance Power BI’s native capabilities.

2. Creating custom visuals from scratch:  allows for complete flexibility and control over the design and functionality of your visuals. You can build these using the Power BI Developer Tools and then import them into your reports.
Once created, custom visuals can be shared within your organization or even published to the marketplace for broader use.
